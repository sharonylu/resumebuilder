# resumebuilder
Built using React.JS and Spring/Java

See it in action (kind of):

https://sharon-resumebuilder.netlify.app

Backend is deployed here: (will show an error/whitelist page if you click on it)

https://sharon-resumebuilder.herokuapp.com/

Note: Netlify's data retrieval (in my experience) is very very very slow. The /view and /pdf pages may not even load.
It's better to just run it locally on your own computer
